#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

For an input size of n = 10, n = 15, n = 20 the algorithm does 10, 15, and 20 iteration respectively. This follows a linear line.

b) O(nlogn)

For an input size of n = 10, n = 15, n = 20 the algorithm does 40, 65, and 100 iteration respectively. This follows a nlogn curve.

c) O(n)

For an input size of n = 10, n = 15, n = 20 the algorithm does 11, 16, and 21 iteration respectively. This follows a linear line.

## Exercise II

You could implement a binary search strategy by starting at the middle floor, drop an egg. If it breaks, move half way down from the current floor. If it does not I would move half way between my current floor and the top floor. This process would be repeated until floor f was found. The time complexity of this seach would be O(logn) where n is the amount of floors.
